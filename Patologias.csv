1IR;Regular;Idioventricular rhythms;30;40;0;0;35 beats/ minute;Absent;Unmeasurable;Wide and bizarre;Deflection opposite QRS complex;0.60 second;None;Called the rhythms of last resort, idioventricular rhythms act as safety mechanisms to prevent ventricular standstill when no impulses are conducted to the ventricles from above the bundle of His. The cells of the His Purkinje system take over and act as the hearts pacemaker to generate electrical impulses. Idioventricular rhythms can occur as ventricular escape beats.;If the patient is symptomatic, treatment should be initiated immediately to increase his heart rate, improve cardiac output, and establish a normal rhythm. A transcutaneous pacemaker may be used in an emergency until a temporary or permanent transvenous pacemaker can be inserted
1SB;Regular;Sinus bradycardia;41;59;0;0;48 beats/minute;Normal;0.16 second;0.08 second;Normal;0.5 second;None;It may occur normally during sleep or in a person with a well conditioned heart an athlete, for example. Many athletes develop it because their well conditioned hearts can maintain a normal stroke volume with less than normal effort. Sinus bradycardia also occurs normally during sleep due to decreased metabolic demands.;If the patient is asymptomatic and his vital signs are stable, treatment is not necessary. Continue to observe his heart rhythm, monitoring the progression and duration of the bradycardia. Evaluate his tolerance of the rhythm at rest and with activity.
1NS;Regular;Normal sinus rhythm;60;100;0;0;60-100 beats/minute;Normal;0.12 to 0.20 second;less 0.12 second;Normal;0.36 to 0.44 second;None;Normal sinus rhythm records an impulse that starts in the sinus node and progresses to the ventricles through a normal conduction pathway from the sinus node to the atria and AV node, through the bundle of His, to the bundle branches, and on to the Purkinje fibers.;To have a healthy heart: Give up smoking, Practice regular physical activity, Walk more, Periodically check your blood pressure, Decrease salt intake if you have high blood pressure, Moderate alcohol consumption, Maintain a suitable weight for height, Control emotions, Take a complete and balanced diet, Perform an annual preventive medical check up.
1ST;Regular;Sinus tachycardia;100;109;121;149;120 beats/minute;Normal;0.14 second;0.06 second;Normal;0.34 second;None;It is one of the heart rhythm disorders characterized by an increased heart pulse rate originating from the sinus node that is the natural pacemaker of the heart.;When treating the asymptomatic patient, focus on determining the cause of the sinus tachycardia. Treatment for a symptomatic patient involves maintaining adequate cardiac output and tissue perfusion and identifying and correcting the underlying cause.
1JT;Regular;Junctional tachycardia;110;120;0;0;115 beats/minute;"Inverted; follows QRS complex";Unmeasurable;0.08 second;Normal;0.36 second;None;Here three or more PJCs occur in a row. This supraventricular tachycardia occurs when an irritable focus from the AV junction has enhanced automaticity, overriding the SA node to function as the pacemakerof heart.  In this arrhythmia, the atria are depolarized by means of retrograde conduction, and conduction through the ventricles is normal.;The underlying cause should be treated. Vagal maneuvers and medications such as verapamil may slow the heart rate for the symptomatic patient. If the patient recently had an MI or heart surgery, he may need a temporary pacemaker to reset the hearts rhythm. A child with a permanent arrhythmia may be resistant to drug therapy and require surgery.
1AT;Regular;Atrial tachycardia;150;179;191;250;210 beats/minute;Almost hidden in T wave;0.12 second;0.10 second;Distorted by P wave;0.20 second;None;Atrial tachycardia is a supraventricular tachycardia, which means the impulses driving the rapid rhythm originate above the ventricles. Atrial tachycardia has an atrial rate from 150 to 250 beats/minute. The rapid rate shortens diastole, resulting in a loss of atrial kick, reduced cardiac output, reduced coronary perfusion, and ischemic myocardial changes.;Digoxin toxicity is one of the most common causes of atrial tachycardia so assessing the patient for signs and symptoms of toxicity and monitoring serum digoxin levels is important. Keep in mind that vagal stimulation can result in bradycardia, ventricular arrhythmias, and asystole. If vagal maneuvers are used, make sure that resuscitative equipment is readily available.
1VT;Regular;Ventricular tachycardia;180;190;0;0;187 beats/minute;Absent;Unmeasurable;"0.16 second; wide and bizarre";Opposite direction of QRS complex;Unmeasurable;None;Ventricular tachycardia is an extremely unstable rhythm. It can occur in short, paroxysmal bursts lasting fewer than 30 seconds and causing few or no symptoms. Alternatively, it can be sustained, requiring immediate treatment to prevent death, even in patients initially able to maintain adequate cardiac output.;Treatment depends on whether the pulse of patient is detectable or undetectable. A patient with pulseless ventricular tachycardia receives the same treatment as one with ventricular fibrillation and requires immediate defibrillation and CPR.
1AF;Regular;Atrial flutter;250;350;0;0;280 beats/minute;Classic saw-toothed appearance;Unmeasurable;0.08 second;Unidentifiable ;Unidentifiable ;None;Originating in a single atrial focus, this rhythm results from circus reentry and possibly increased automaticity. On an ECG, the P waves lose their distinction due to the rapid atrial rate. The waves blend together in a sawtoothed appearance and are called flutter waves, or f waves. These waves are the hallmark of atrial flutter.;An asymptomatic patient needs no treatment. For a patient displaying mild symptoms, treatment focuses on maintaining cardiac output and identifying the cause of the sinus arrest. That may involve stopping medications that contribute to SA node suppression, such as digoxin, beta adrenergic blockers, and calcium channel blockers.
2PA;Irregular;Premature atrial contractions;85;95;0;0;90 beats/minute;"Abnormal with PAC; some lost in previous T wave";0.20 second;0.08 second;"Abnormal with some embedded P waves
";0.32 second;Noncompensatory pause;Premature atrial contractions (PACs) originate outside the SA node and usually result from an irritable spot, or focus, in the atria that takes over as pacemaker for one or more beats. The SA node fires an impulse, but then an irritable focus jumps in, firing its own impulse before the SA node can fire again.;Most patients who are asymptomatic do not need treatment. In symptomatic patients, however, treatment may focus on eliminating the cause, such as caffeine, alcohol, and nicotine.
2PJ;Irregular;Premature junctional contraction;96;119;0;0;100 beats/minute;"Inverted and precedes the QRS complex with PJC; herwise normal configuration ";0.14 second for the underlying rhythm and 0.06 second for the PJC ;0.06 second;Normal;0.36 second ;Pause after PJC;A premature junctional contraction (PJC) is a beat that occurs before a normal beat and causes an irregular rhythm. This ectopic beat occurs when an irritable location within the AV junction acts as a pacemaker and fires either prematurely or out of sequence. As with all beats produced by the AV junction, the atria are depolarized in retrograde fashion, causing an inverted P wave. The ventricles are depolarized normally.;If the patient is symptomatic, however, treatment aims to alleviate signs and symptoms and correct the underlying cause of the arrhythmia. Atropine or epinephrine may be given initially for symptomatic bradycardia. A temporary or permanent pacemaker may be used..
2AF;Irregular;Atrial fibrillatioN;120;140;0;0;130 beats/minute ;"Absent; replaced by fine fibrillatory waves ";Indiscernible;0.08 second;Indiscernible;Unmeasurable ;None;Atrial fibrillation stems from the firing of a number of impulses in reentry pathways. As with atrial flutter, atrial fibrillation results in a loss of atrial kick. The ectopic impulses may fire at a rate of 400 to 600 times/minute, causing the atria to quiver instead of contract.;The major therapeutic goal in treating atrial fibrillation is to reduce the ventricular response rate to below 100 beats/minute. This may be accomplished either by drugs that control the ventricular response or by cardioversion and drugs in combination to convert the rhythm to sinus. Atrial fibrillation is treated following the same guidelines as atrial flutter.
